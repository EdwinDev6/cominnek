```

```bash
cd ./cominnek
```

2. Install `cominnek` module

# Usage

- **[Update version](#update-version)**: Commit, push and publish the theme to BigCommerce
- **[Push](#push)**: Commit and push the branch to GitHub
- **[Publish](#publish)**: Commit, push and create the pull request to develop in GitHub.
- **[Feature](#feature)**: Create a new feature branch
- **[Stash](#stash)**: Stash changes in a branch to another branch 
  
## Update version
Commit, push and publish the theme to BigCommerce. The commit going to be "update version" by default. 

***Important:** Just use this in the test branch.*

```bash
cominnek update-version -a
```
the commit will be: `update version`


| flag               | type          | description                 |
| ------------------ | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| `-a --apply`       |Boolean        | Apply the theme automaticly |
## Push
Commit and push the branch to GitHub
```bash
cominnek push --feat "home" --message "do some modifications"
```
the commit will be: `feat(home):{Ticket} do some modifications`

*{Ticket} is the ticket number* See more information in the [Ticketing system](#ticketing-system)

| flag               | type          | description                            |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------|
| `-F --feat`        |string         | make the commit with the prefix feat() |
| `-f --fix`         |string         | make the commit with the prefix fix()  |
| `-m --message`     |string*        | Receives the commit message            |
| `-y --yes`         |Boolean (false)| Skip the confirmation question         |

*\* required*

## Publish
Commit, push and create the pull request to develop in GitHub.
The usage is the same as [push](#push) just with the difference that this creates a pull request.
```bash
cominnek publish --feat "home" --message "do some modifications"
```
## Feature
Create a new feature branch using git flow. Also, this going to checkout `develop` branch if it isn't checked out.

```bash
cominnek feature --ticket "{Ticket}"
```
This the equivalent of: `git flow feature start {Ticket}` or `git-flow feature start {Ticket}` on MacOS
| flag               | type          | description                            |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------|
| `-t --ticket`      |string*        | name to assign to the feature          |

*\* required*

## Stash
Stash all the changes in the current branch and apply the changes to another branch.

```bash
cominnek stash --ticket "{Ticket}"
```
*For features* Ex: `feature/{Ticket}`

```bash
cominnek stash --branch "{branch}"
```
*For branch that is not a feature* Ex: `develop`

| flag               | type          | description                            |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------|
| `-t --ticket`      |string         | name of the feature that's will be applied the change     |
| `-b --branch`      |string         | name of the branch that's will be applied the changes       |

## Examples and more

You can add a body to commit using the `--message` flag twice.

```bash
cominnek push -f "home" -m "Changes in home page" -m "the title was aligned to right"
```
This is the same as `git commit` -m "fix(home):{Ticket} Changes in home page" -m "the title was aligned to right"`

*{Ticket} is the ticket number* See more information in the [Ticketing system](#ticketing-system)

---
To do a commit without a scope, use the flag `-f, --fix` or `-F, --feat` with a space. 
```bash
cominnek push -F " " -m "theme setup"
```
the commit will be: `feat(): theme setup`

# Ticketing system
This takes the ticket number from the branch name. This is important to create the pull request with the correct ticket number.

Example: 

You are in the branch `feature/MJ-11` 

The ticker number will be `MJ-11`

If you execute the command:

```bash
cominnek push -F "home" -m "Changes in home page"
``` 

the commit will be: `feat(home):MJ-11 Changes in home page`

### What about if I am not in a feature branch?
This going to let you know that you are not in a feature branch and you will accept the commit without a ticket number.

Example: You're in the branch `develop`

```bash
$ cominnek push -F "home" -m "Changes in home page"
  This is not a feature. Do you want to continue? (yes or no)
        Commit message: "feat(home): Changes in home page"
```
